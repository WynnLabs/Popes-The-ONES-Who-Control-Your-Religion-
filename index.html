            <h2>Pope John XII (955–964)</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>John XII, elected at age 18, transformed the Lateran Palace into a site of debauchery, reportedly turning it into a brothel and engaging in adultery with multiple women, including his father’s mistress. Historical accounts, such as those by Liutprand of Cremona, describe him invoking pagan gods like Jupiter and Venus during ceremonies, an act some see as violating Exodus 20:3-5 ("You shall have no other gods before me") and Deuteronomy 12:30-31, which warns against adopting the detestable practices of pagan nations. His reign included ordaining a deacon in a stable and blinding a cardinal, actions critics argue stray from biblical leadership standards (1 Timothy 3:1-7). The use of pagan rituals, even if symbolic, has been debated as a departure from the monotheistic purity demanded in scripture.</p>

        <section id="sixtus-iv">
            <h2>Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484)</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Sixtus IV, known for building the Sistine Chapel, was accused of nepotism, appointing relatives like Giuliano della Rovere (later Julius II) to high church positions, which some interpret as contrary to Acts 20:28’s call to shepherd without personal gain. Rumors of homosexual relationships, including with young clerics, conflict with Romans 1:26-27, which condemns such acts. His involvement in the Spanish Inquisition and the sale of indulgences—practices some link to pagan financial exploitation—has been criticized against Matthew 21:12-13, where Jesus condemns turning the temple into a marketplace. The blending of church authority with secular power echoes pagan theocracies, raising questions about adherence to Christ’s separation from worldly rule (John 18:36).</p>

        <section id="alexander-vi">
            <h2>Pope Alexander VI (1492–1503)</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Actions and Legacy</h3>
                <p>Born Rodrigo Borgia, Alexander VI ascended through bribery, violating 1 Timothy 6:10’s warning against the love of money. He fathered at least seven illegitimate children, including Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, using Church funds to elevate them, contravening Luke 16:10-12’s call for faithful stewardship. His reign featured the infamous Banquet of Chestnuts (1501), a festival allegedly involving 50 courtesans and clergy in orgiastic rites the night before All Hallows, blending Christian and pagan elements like the Celtic Samhain. Critics argue this mirrors Deuteronomy 12:29-31’s prohibition against adopting pagan customs, such as fertility rituals tied to Roman Saturnalia.</p>
                <h3>Cesare Borgia: The Son’s Role</h3>
                <p>Cesare, once a cardinal, resigned to lead military campaigns, marrying into French nobility to secure alliances for a Borgia state, funded by papal wealth. His ruthless tactics, including betrayals and assassinations (e.g., of his brother Juan), reflect a departure from Christian ethics (Matthew 5:44). The Banquet of Chestnuts, hosted in his apartments, showcased his father’s influence, with accounts suggesting Alexander VI participated, reinforcing claims of pagan indulgence over biblical holiness (1 Corinthians 6:18-20). Cesare’s portrait, possibly by Bartolomeo Veneto, symbolizes this corrupt legacy.</p>

            <h2>Pope Clement VII (1523–1534)</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Clement VII, a Medici, prioritized political alliances during the Sack of Rome (1527), failing to unite Christendom against the Reformation, which some see as neglecting John 17:21’s call for unity. His hesitation to annul Henry VIII’s marriage led to England’s break from Rome, criticized as a worldly compromise (James 4:4). The use of elaborate court rituals, reminiscent of pagan royal ceremonies, has been debated against the simplicity of early Christian worship (Acts 2:46-47), with some linking his reign to a drift toward secular pomp over spiritual purity.</p>

            <h2>Pope Francis (2013–2025)</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Francis, the first Jesuit pope, endorsed civil unions for same-sex couples in 2020, a stance some argue contradicts Genesis 2:24 and Romans 1:26-27. His participation in indigenous rituals, such as the 2019 Amazon Synod’s tree-planting ceremony with Pachamama statues—seen by critics as a pagan fertility symbol—has sparked debate under Exodus 20:4-5’s ban on graven images. The 2022 Canadian smudging ritual, invoking spirits, further fuels claims of syncretism, conflicting with Deuteronomy 18:10-12’s rejection of divination. His emphasis on ecological spirituality, while innovative, is critiqued as echoing pagan earth worship.</p>

            <h2>Apocrypha and Book of Enoch</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The Council of Trent (1545–1563) affirmed the Apocrypha (e.g., Tobit, Judith) as canonical, despite their exclusion by early Jewish and Protestant traditions, raising questions under Revelation 22:18-19 about adding to scripture. The Book of Enoch, referenced in Jude 1:14-15 but omitted from the canon, details fallen angels and apocalyptic visions, with some arguing its rejection aligns with biblical purity, while others see its exclusion as a loss of prophetic insight. The debate reflects tensions between tradition and scripture, with pagan influences in apocryphal cosmology (e.g., angel hierarchies) cited by critics.</p>

            <h2>Marian Worship</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Marian dogmas—Immaculate Conception (1854) and Assumption (1950)—elevate Mary’s role, with practices like the Rosary and May crowning seen by some as idolatrous under Exodus 20:4-5. Critics trace these to pagan goddess worship (e.g., Isis, Artemis), arguing they dilute Christ’s mediation (1 Timothy 2:5). The veneration of statues and processions, especially in Latin America, echoes pre-Christian fertility rites, contrasting with the early church’s focus on Christ alone (Colossians 3:17). Defenders see it as honoring a biblical figure, not worshiping her.</p>

        <section id="homosexuality">
            <h2>Homosexual Marriage</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Francis’s 2020 support for civil unions, while not church-sanctioned marriage, is critiqued against Leviticus 18:22 and Romans 1:26-27, which condemn same-sex relations. This shift from traditional doctrine is seen by some as a concession to secular culture, echoing pagan tolerance of diverse sexual practices (e.g., Roman cults). The lack of biblical precedent for such unions fuels debate, with opponents citing Matthew 19:4-6’s affirmation of heterosexual marriage, while supporters argue it reflects Christ’s compassion (Luke 6:36).</p>

            <h2>Leonardo da Vinci's Depiction</h2>
            <button class="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci, though not directly linked to the Borgias, influenced Renaissance art, including potential portraits of Cesare Borgia. The generated image blends a da Vinci-style Christ with a Borgia son figure, reflecting the era’s fusion of sacred and secular. Alexander VI commissioned art to legitimize his rule, possibly influencing da Vinci’s works, while Cesare’s military exploits were immortalized in art, blending Christian and pagan motifs (e.g., Roman triumphs). This artistic syncretism mirrors the ritual controversies discussed.</p>
